# C/C++ for Cursor


The C/C++ extension adds Language Server Protocol (LSP), debugging, and code browsing support to Cursor.

## Pre-requisites
C++ is a compiled language meaning your program's source code must be translated (compiled) before it can be run on your computer. The C/C++ extension **does not include a C++ compiler**. You will need to install a compiler, such as Clang, GCC, or MSVC.

## Additional Components
This extension bundles [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/) for Language Server Protocol (LSP) support, [CodeLLDB](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb) for debugging support, and [CMake Tools](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools) for CMake support. These additional components are not required and can be disabled or uninstalled individually.
